To facilitate the acquisition and use of the MAVC100 dataset, we have backed up the original online live musical video streams.

These parts are the original data of the MAVC100, all from the Internet. After our processing and screening, there are a total of 200 live video clips, the length of each clip is 30 seconds, which contains the target events we are interested in. 

Please note that the MAVC100 dataset can only be used for research purposes and not for other purposes. If there is any infringement, please contact us and we will delete it in time.

Here are the detection results based on rule-embedded audio-visual VAD network in the paper (Rule-embedded network for audio-visual voice activity detection in live musical video streams, https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14168).

The font on the top left of the video shows the activity of the anchor at the current moment. The anchor speaks, it shows speech; the anchor sings, it shows singing; the anchor has no action and there is sound in the background, it shows silence; otherwise it shows others.
